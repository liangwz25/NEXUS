**a Niche for EXploring groUndwater and Surface-water interaction**  

  
### About ME  

  


  

### Main interest
1) Hydrodynamics and biogeochemical cycling in surface water-groundwater interactions at different scales (small: intertidal zone/benthic sediment interface, large: deltaic/continental pathway).  
2) Machine learning-driven analysis of environmental big data (in-situ observation/remote sensing) for natural hazard prediction and informing environmental/sustainable policymaking.  
3) Nanotechnology on water quality monitoring.
