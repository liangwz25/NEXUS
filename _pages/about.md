----------Welcome to NEXUS LAB--------------
This is Dr. Wenzhao LIANG's home on the web!

Main interest
======
1) Hydrodynamics and biogeochemical cycling in surface water-groundwater interactions at different scales (small: intertidal zone/benthic sediment interface, large: deltaic/continental pathway).
2) Machine learning-driven analysis of environmental big data (in-situ observation/remote sensing) for natural hazard prediction and informing environmental/sustainable policymaking.
3) Nanotechnology on water quality monitoring.
